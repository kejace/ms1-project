          <p><span style = "font-family: poynter-oldstyle-display; text-transform: uppercase">Gender inequality</span>, sexual harassment, sexual assault--in recent years, these terms have been so commonplace in the collective colloquial verbatim that it does not strike as odd to hear a casual conversation about street harassment, or get caught up in a wave of public outrage over the latest figure convicted of sexual assault. Since the advent of the #MeToo movement in the fall of 2017, there has been a spike in activism, calling for visibility of these issues and, more importantly, accountability of the perpetrators. And yet, this is but a contemporary phenomenon. Such a visible approach to matters of sexual harassment would have been unthinkable in the past; far from being the potentially empowering and validating act that it is now, to participate in public allegation meant a near complete emotional, social, and career suicide. 
          <p>In the field of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), this is still very much the case. The National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) published a report in 2018 that states that the harassment of women in STEM is the worst outside of any sector besides the military.[source] With its historical male dominance and organizational tolerance of sexism and sexual harassment, STEM academia fosters an especially harsh environment for women. The consequences of this have been well documented by recent reports all over the board, from individual to national institutions. The aim of this project is not to reiterate the points made, but to break down the perpetual problem of sexism and sexual harassment in STEM academia into smaller issues that can be understood by data.</p>
          <p>Let’s start by looking at data with the most apparent link to sexual harassment. Julie Libarkin, a professor at Michigan State University helming the Geocognition Research Laboratory, created a database of publicly available reports of sexual misconduct and violation of relationship policies at US institutions, dating as far back as 1978 [source]. The entire database consists of well over 700 cases. From this, the 189 cases that were tied to perpetrators in STEM disciplines were examined. It is important to note that this is a database solely of cases that have been publicly recorded. Though there seems to be an increased prevalence of misconduct cases in recent years, this does not necessarily mean the rate of misconduct was low in the past; more likely, people have started to feel more comfortable in coming forward with their experiences as public scrutiny of sexual harassment issues have become commonplace.</p>

        <p>If we look at the summaries of the outcomes, 45% of the outcomes ended in no significant action by the institutions, or in retirement or resignation by the perpetrators themselves. Even in cases where the perpetrators were suspended, some institutions granted paid leave during that time period. Overall, this dataset shows us that the institutions involved often times did not decree consequences to the perpetrators, and even when they did, the perpetrators still enjoyed monetary compensation and membership to powerful national STEM organizations that have influence on grant money, career trajectory, and future memberships of young scientists.</p>

        <p>In all cases, initial complaints were filed well before official investigations took place. There were multiple accounts of sexual misconduct by the perpetrators before and after these complaints. There were “whisper networks” of women telling newcomers to stay away from these men, or to be careful around them. These men held so much power and influence in both the scientific world and their institutions that it took the voices of countless women and decades of damage before appropriate action was taken.</p>
        <p><span style = "font-family: poynter-oldstyle-display; text-transform: uppercase">Certainly because</span> of the actions of men like these and those that support them (amongst other reasons), women have had difficulty navigating the STEM academic environment. Especially concerning are the retention rates for women in advanced stages of their career--there is an apparent and extreme pipeline problem that has yet to be resolved.</p>
        <p>Institutions are aware of this, and as early as the 90s, have published faculty equity reports in order to mitigate the problem. When comparing data obtained from faculty equity reports of two prestigious universities in New York City, we see a few patterns emerge. First of all, the percentage of female faculty in the sciences have consistently been the lowest across major disciplines. There is little improvement when comparing the numbers; Columbia, which has the higher rate of female faculty in the sciences, has only managed to raise the percentage from 16% in 2000 to 22% in 2016 (not even a quarter of the faculty).</p>
