          <p><span style = "font-family: poynter-oldstyle-display; text-transform: uppercase">Gender inequality</span>, sexual harassment, sexual assault--in recent years, these terms have been so commonplace in the collective colloquial verbatim that it does not strike as odd to hear a casual conversation about street harassment, or get caught up in a wave of public outrage over the latest figure convicted of sexual assault. Since the advent of the #MeToo movement in the fall of 2017, there has been a spike in activism, calling for visibility of these issues and, more importantly, accountability of the perpetrators. And yet, this is but a contemporary phenomenon. Such a visible approach to matters of sexual harassment would have been unthinkable in the past; far from being the potentially empowering and validating act that it is now, to participate in public allegation meant a near complete emotional, social, and career suicide. 
          <p>In the field of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), this is still very much the case. The National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) published a report in 2018 that states that the harassment of women in STEM is the worst outside of any sector besides the military.[source] With its historical male dominance and organizational tolerance of sexism and sexual harassment, STEM academia fosters an especially harsh environment for women. The consequences of this have been well documented by recent reports all over the board, from individual to national institutions. The aim of this project is not to reiterate the points made, but to break down the perpetual problem of sexism and sexual harassment in STEM academia into smaller issues that can be understood by data.</p>
          <p>Let’s start by looking at data with the most apparent link to sexual harassment. Julie Libarkin, a professor at Michigan State University helming the Geocognition Research Laboratory, created a database of publicly available reports of sexual misconduct and violation of relationship policies at US institutions, dating as far back as 1978 [source]. The entire database consists of well over 700 cases. From this, the 189 cases that were tied to perpetrators in STEM disciplines were examined. It is important to note that this is a database solely of cases that have been publicly recorded. Though there seems to be an increased prevalence of misconduct cases in recent years, this does not necessarily mean the rate of misconduct was low in the past; more likely, people have started to feel more comfortable in coming forward with their experiences as public scrutiny of sexual harassment issues have become commonplace.</p>

        <p>If we look at the summaries of the outcomes, 45% of the outcomes ended in no significant action by the institutions, or in retirement or resignation by the perpetrators themselves. Even in cases where the perpetrators were suspended, some institutions granted paid leave during that time period. Overall, this dataset shows us that the institutions involved often times did not decree consequences to the perpetrators, and even when they did, the perpetrators still enjoyed monetary compensation and membership to powerful national STEM organizations that have influence on grant money, career trajectory, and future memberships of young scientists.</p>

        <p>In all cases, initial complaints were filed well before official investigations took place. There were multiple accounts of sexual misconduct by the perpetrators before and after these complaints. There were “whisper networks” of women telling newcomers to stay away from these men, or to be careful around them. These men held so much power and influence in both the scientific world and their institutions that it took the voices of countless women and decades of damage before appropriate action was taken.</p>
        <p><span style = "font-family: poynter-oldstyle-display; text-transform: uppercase">Certainly because</span> of the actions of men like these and those that support them (amongst other reasons), women have had difficulty navigating the STEM academic environment. Especially concerning are the retention rates for women in advanced stages of their career--there is an apparent and extreme pipeline problem that has yet to be resolved.</p>
        <p>Institutions are aware of this, and as early as the 90s, have published faculty equity reports in order to mitigate the problem. When comparing data obtained from faculty equity reports of two prestigious universities in New York City, we see a few patterns emerge. First of all, the percentage of female faculty in the sciences have consistently been the lowest across major disciplines. There is little improvement when comparing the numbers; Columbia, which has the higher rate of female faculty in the sciences, has only managed to raise the percentage from 16% in 2000 to 22% in 2016 (not even a quarter of the faculty).</p>

        <p style = "margin-top:200px">The pipeline problem becomes obvious when taking a closer look at Columbia’s breakdown of women in the sciences. Women make up half of the undergraduate student body majoring in the sciences--at times even more than half, the highest rate being 54%. At the graduate level, this percentage drops off slightly, but in the past few years, have been trending upwards to 50%. The drop-off in numbers emerges at the tenure-eligible faculty and especially tenured faculty level. In 1990, a mere 8.3% of tenured faculty were women; in 2015, 21%. </p>

        <p><span style = "font-family: poynter-oldstyle-display; text-transform: uppercase">The pipeline problem</span> is not a simple one to solve. However, the innate sexism in STEM academia does nothing but hurt the case for women. Dr. BethAnn McLaughlin, an assistant professor of neurology and pharmacology at Vanderbilt University, and a leader in female advocacy in STEM, experienced this issue firsthand. As a tenure track professor, her tenure was initially approved in 2015 by her department and the Faculty Appointments & Promotions Committee, but the process was derailed for nearly two years while a disciplinary investigation against her took place concerning an issue over her behavioral conduct. This probe was initiated by complaints from Aurelio Galli, a then colleague at Vanderbilt, whom she testified against during his sexual harassment case in 2015. Though the probe found her not guilty, when the process restarted in 2017, Jeff Blaser, the dean of Vanderbilt School of Medicine circulated the report to the Executive Committee of the Executive Faculty (ECEF) at the School of Medicine. She was then unanimously denied tenure. The process has been described as “highly irregular” by academics and lawyers alike.</p>
        <p>Dr. McLaughlin has since ramped up her efforts in advocacy for accountability in STEM academia. She has played a key role in convincing organizations such as the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) to adopt policies that allow honors and memberships to be stripped from proven sexual harassers. She has also launched a non-profit organization called MeTooStem that aims to give a voice to those who have been harassed, and to call for accountability at the institutional level. The hashtag #MeTooStem has also become a rallying point for women in STEM. Here are some tweets from female scientists, suggesting ways in which allies can support those undergoing harassment or discrimination:</p>

        <p><span style = "font-family: poynter-oldstyle-display; text-transform: uppercase">To alleviate</span> sexual misconduct, harassment, and discrimination is a challenge in any field--to tackle this in STEM academia is particularly difficult. In order to do this, we must first understand the myriad of ways in which sexual harassment has infiltrated the field, and call for institutional change. As the greater society continues to increase awareness and coverage of these issues, it is up to us to rise to the occasion and ride this wave to equal opportunity and treatment of all sex and genders. A field so advanced in its discoveries should not be stuck in the past.</p>
