          <hr style = "margin-bottom: 5vh">
          <p><span style = "font-family: futura-pt; text-transform: uppercase; font-size: 20px;"><b>Gender inequality</b></span>, sexual harassment, sexual assault--in recent years, these terms have been so commonplace in the collective colloquial verbatim that it does not strike as odd to hear a casual conversation about street harassment, or get caught up in a wave of public outrage over the latest figure convicted of sexual assault. Since the advent of the #MeToo movement in the fall of 2017, there has been a spike in activism, calling for visibility of these issues and, more importantly, <a href= https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/03/catharine-mackinnon-what-metoo-has-changed/585313/ target="_blank">accountability of the perpetrators</a>. And yet, this is but a contemporary phenomenon. Such a visible approach to matters of sexual harassment would have been unthinkable in the past; far from being the potentially empowering and validating act that it is now, to participate in public allegation meant a near complete <a href=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1557085110376343 target="_blank">emotional, social, and career suicide</a>. 
          <p>In the field of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), this is still very much the case. The National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) published a report in 2018 that states that the harassment of women in STEM is the <a href= https://www.nap.edu/catalog/24994/sexual-harassment-of-women-climate-culture-and-consequences-in-academic target="_blank"> worst outside of any sector</a> besides the military. With its <a href=https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/publications/2016/nsb20161.pdf target="_blank">historical male dominance</a> and organizational tolerance of sexism and sexual harassment, STEM academia fosters an especially harsh environment for women. The consequences of this have been well documented by <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/18/magazine/salk-institute-discrimination-science.html target="_blank">recent reports</a> covering institutions all over the board. The aim of this project is not to reiterate the points made, but to break down the perpetual problem of sexism and sexual harassment in STEM academia into smaller issues that can be understood by data.</p>
          <h4 style = "text-align: center; margin-top:5vh;">Part One</h4>
          <hr style = "margin-bottom:5vh;">
          <p>Let’s start by looking at data with the most apparent link to sexual harassment. Julie Libarkin, a professor at Michigan State University helming the Geocognition Research Laboratory, created a database of publicly available <a href=https://geocognitionresearchlaboratory.com/2018/08/20/the-academic-sexual-misconduct-database/ target="_blank">reports of sexual misconduct and violation of relationship policies</a> at US institutions, dating as far back as 1978. The entire database consists of well over 700 cases. From this, the 189 cases that were tied to perpetrators in STEM disciplines were examined. It is important to note that this is a database solely of cases that have been publicly recorded. Though there seems to be an increased prevalence of misconduct cases in recent years, this does not necessarily mean the rate of misconduct was low in the past; more likely, people have started to feel more comfortable in coming forward with their experiences as public scrutiny of sexual harassment issues have become commonplace.</p>

        <p>Institutions are aware of this, and as early as the 90s, have published faculty equity reports in order to mitigate the problem. When comparing data obtained from faculty equity reports of two prestigious universities in New York City, we see a few patterns emerge. First of all, the percentage of female faculty in the sciences have <a href=https://as.nyu.edu/content/dam/nyu-as/as/documents/2018EquityStudy.pdf target="_blank">consistently been the lowest</a> across major disciplines. There is little improvement when comparing the numbers; Columbia, which has the higher rate of female faculty in the sciences, has only managed to raise the percentage from <a href=http://senate.columbia.edu/archives/reports_archive/14-15/csw_pipeline%20report_2004-13.pdf target="_blank">16% in 2000 to 22% in 2016</a> (not even a quarter of the faculty).</p>

            <p>The pipeline problem becomes obvious when taking a closer look at Columbia’s breakdown of women in the sciences in each step of the academic career ladder.  Women make up <span style = "color: #bf033b; font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">half of the undergraduate student body majoring in the sciences</span>--at times even more than half, the highest rate being <span style = "color: #bf033b; font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">54%</span>. At the graduate level, this percentage drops off slightly, but in the past few years, have been trending upwards to 50%. </p>
          </div>
          <div class='step' data-step='2'>
            <p>The drop-off in numbers emerges at the tenure-eligible faculty and especially tenured faculty level. In 1990, a mere <span style = "color: #bf033b; font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">8.3%</span> of tenured faculty were women; in 2015, <span style = "color: #bf033b; font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">21%</span>.

However, the innate sexism in STEM academia does nothing but hurt the case for women. Dr. BethAnn McLaughlin, a former assistant professor of neurology and pharmacology at Vanderbilt University and a leader in female advocacy in STEM, experienced this issue firsthand. As a tenure track professor, her tenure was initially approved in 2015 by her department and the Faculty Appointments & Promotions Committee, but the process was derailed for nearly two years while a disciplinary investigation against her took place concerning an issue over her behavioral conduct. This probe was initiated by complaints from Aurelio Galli, a then colleague at Vanderbilt, whom she testified against during his sexual harassment case in 2015. Though the probe found her not guilty, when the process restarted in 2017, Jeff Blaser, the dean of Vanderbilt School of Medicine circulated the report to the Executive Committee of the Executive Faculty (ECEF) at the School of Medicine. She was then <a href=https://www.chronicle.com/article/This-Scientist-Was-the/245806 target="_blank">unanimously denied tenure</a>. The process has been described as “highly irregular” by academics and lawyers alike.</p>
        <p>Dr. McLaughlin has since ramped up her efforts in advocacy for accountability in STEM academia. She has played a key role in convincing organizations such as the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) to adopt policies that <a href=https://www.asbmb.org/asbmb-today/policy/090118/women-in-science-take-on-sexual-harassment target="_blank">allow honors and memberships to be stripped</a> from proven sexual harassers. She has also launched a non-profit organization called <a href=https://metoostem.com/ target="_blank">MeTooStem</a> that aims to give a voice to those who have been harassed, and to call for accountability at the institutional level. The hashtag #MeTooStem has also become a rallying point for women in STEM. Here are some tweets from female scientists, suggesting ways in which allies can support those undergoing harassment or discrimination:</p>

        <hr style = "margin-bottom: 5vh">
        <p>Visibility of the issue of sexual harassment in STEM has steadily increased to the point where it has piqued mainstream attention. As more and more issues are exposed into the open and discontent rises, it becomes necessary to have a plan that organizes this anger into actionable change. Based on the collected data and recommendations of advocates of women in STEM academia, the following are general focus points that should be addressed:
        <ol style = "margin-top: 5vh; margin-bottom: 5vh;">
          <li><span style = "color: #bf033b; font-size: 16px;"><b>Accountability by institutions</b></span>: <br>Institutions must hold perpetrators of sexual misconduct accountable for their actions, and assign appropriate consequences in a timely manner</li>
          <li><span style = "color: #bf033b; font-size: 16px;"><b>Accountability by national STEM organisations</b></span>: <br>National organizations such as NIH and NASEM must revoke honors, awards, and funding from investigators found guilty of sexual misconduct</li>
          <li><span style = "color: #bf033b; font-size: 16px;"><b>Educational opportunities that increase awareness of sexual harassment and discrimination at a younger age</b></span>: <br>Especially in an environment such as STEM where sexism is ingrained, educational opportunities are necessary to mitigate the negative effects of such an environment.</li>
          <li><span style = "color: #bf033b; font-size: 16px;"><b>Better institutional support for those who have experienced harassment</b></span>: <br>Institutions must provide support for survivors of harassment, not protection for the perpetrators</li>
          <li><span style = "color: #bf033b; font-size: 16px;"><b>Promotion of more women to leadership roles</b></span>: <br>Without women in leadership roles, we will continue to have biases against women when considering promotions</li>
          <li><span style = "color: #bf033b; font-size: 16px;"><b>Educational opportunities for allies of women in STEM</b></span>: <br>It is important for women in STEM to have support networks, and male allies should be educated on how best to support women who have experienced harassment and/or discrimination</li>
        </ol>
         <p>One of the first steps towards change is awareness, in any situation, no matter how big or small--sexual harassment in STEM academia is no different. As the greater society continues to increase awareness and coverage of these issues, it is up to us to rise to the occasion and ride this wave to equal opportunity and treatment of all sexes and genders. A field so advanced in its discoveries has no reason to be stuck in the past.</p>

      <h4><span style= "font-size: 20px;">Methodology</span></h4>
      <p class = "methods">Data was collected from multiple sources for each of the major issues covered in this project. Details of sexual misconduct in academia were obtained by a database compiled by the Geocognition Research Laboratory at Michigan State university, helmed by Julie Libarkin, a professor of Earth and Environmental Sciences. This <a href=https://geocognitionresearchlaboratory.com/2018/08/20/the-academic-sexual-misconduct-database/ target="_blank">database</a>, titled “The Academic Sexual Misconduct and Violations of Relationship Policies Database”, lists all publicly available cases of sexual misconduct and violation of relationship policies at US institutions, starting as early as 1987. For each case mentioned, the database lists the name, institution, discipline, outcome, and links to media sources outlining details of the case. From this, only cases pertaining to perpetrators in STEM disciplines were extracted for use in the visualization. The outcome of each case was summarized into a succinct categories that best described the outcome. If there were multiple outcomes, the outcome with more serious implications was selected for use.</span></p>
      <p class="methods">To visualize case studies of academics accused of sexual misconduct, reports in the media were used. To make sure that evidence was accounted for, only famous cases that were well documented and already substantially exposed by the media were visualized. Dr. Inder Verma's case was covered by multiple news outlets across the US after several sexual discrimination lawsuits were filed against the institute, citing his name, in 2017. Subsequently, Science, a distinguished journal of scientific discoveries published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the world’s oldest and largest general science organization, conducted a <a href=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6388/480.full target="_blank">four month investigation</a> into allegations of sexual misconduct by Verma that spanned from 1976 to 2016. Five women agreed to be named in the resulting story, as well as three who requested to remain anonymous. Dr. Francisco Ayala's case was also covered by many news outlets, but main details of his case were obtained by the official investigation report by the Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity of UC Irvine (no longer publicly accessible at this time). This report includes statements from four complainants, who have all agreed to be named. Dr. Lawrence Krauss' case has been covered by multiple news outlets along with Buzzfeed News, which published a <a href=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/lawrence-krauss-sexual-harassment-allegations target="_blank">comprehensive report</a> of the allegations and complaints against him in February 2018. For all three of these cases, multiple news sources were crosschecked to minimize the chances of false data points.</p>
