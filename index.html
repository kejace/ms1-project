          <p><span style = "font-family: poynter-oldstyle-display; text-transform: uppercase">Gender inequality</span>, sexual harassment, sexual assault--in recent years, these terms have been so commonplace in the collective colloquial verbatim that it does not strike as odd to hear a casual conversation about street harassment, or get caught up in a wave of public outrage over the latest figure convicted of sexual assault. Since the advent of the #MeToo movement in the fall of 2017, there has been a spike in activism, calling for visibility of these issues and, more importantly, accountability of the perpetrators. And yet, this is but a contemporary phenomenon. Such a visible approach to matters of sexual harassment would have been unthinkable in the past; far from being the potentially empowering and validating act that it is now, to participate in public allegation meant a near complete emotional, social, and career suicide. 
          <p>In the field of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), this is still very much the case. The National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) published a report in 2018 that states that the harassment of women in STEM is the worst outside of any sector besides the military.[source] With its historical male dominance and organizational tolerance of sexism and sexual harassment, STEM academia fosters an especially harsh environment for women. The consequences of this have been well documented by recent reports all over the board, from individual to national institutions. The aim of this project is not to reiterate the points made, but to break down the perpetual problem of sexism and sexual harassment in STEM academia into smaller issues that can be understood by data.</p>
          <p>Let’s start by looking at data with the most apparent link to sexual harassment. Julie Libarkin, a professor at Michigan State University helming the Geocognition Research Laboratory, created a database of publicly available reports of sexual misconduct and violation of relationship policies at US institutions, dating as far back as 1978 [source]. The entire database consists of well over 700 cases. From this, the 226 cases that were tied to perpetrators in STEM disciplines were examined.</p>
          <p>Each individual case was mapped as a dot onto a histogram spanning from 1980 to 2018. The colors represent the outcomes of each case. Try hovering over the dots to get the overview of each case. If you’d like to take a closer look, try clicking on the dot--it will take you to a news article that covers the case in more detail.</p>
