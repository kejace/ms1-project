## Project Abstract
STEM academia, a historically male dominated environment, has brought many bouts of hardship to women pursuing careers in the field. Sexual misconduct, harassment, and discrimination are rampant--the National Academy of Sciences reported in 2018 that the rate of sexual harassment in STEM is second only to that of the military. These cases of sexual harassment are often times overlooked and even condoned by institutions that first and foremost are concerned about their reputations, and the reputations of those who bring them recognition and funding. Perpetuating these behaviors is harmful to society as a whole--having imbalanced representation in STEM research not only negatively impacts the women in the field, but spreads to other areas of society. For example, because clinical trials and medical research have historically been conducted on male populations, womenâ€™s medical conditions are frequently misdiagnosed and leads to higher rates of mortality in women (i.e. misdiagnosis of heart attacks).

Through the visualization of publicly available sexual misconduct cases, detailed timelines of the careers of prominent investigators felled by sexual misconduct allegations, and a longitudinal look at the numbers of women pursuing careers in STEM academia, I point out the magnitude of the problem and the implications of it that have long hindered women in STEM: many cases of sexual misconduct conclude with little to no action by the institutions, and behind each formal case of sexual misconduct lies multiple unreported allegations of harassment. The pipeline problem for women in STEM academia is severe, with the rates of women pursuing careers in STEM academia dropping to as low as ~8% from ~50% at the undergraduate level. Institutions and national organizations must hold perpetrators of sexual misconduct accountable for their actions in a timely manner, and provide resources to support women who have experienced harassment in order to increase the retention rates of women pursuing STEM academia. 


*Though sexual harassment affects male-identifying, gender non-binary, and transgender populations, in this paper I will be focusing predominantly on sexism & sexual harassment pertaining to women and women-identifying populations.*
